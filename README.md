### Instructions
PS: To just see the files, a refresh of each page might be necessary for a couple of times since the files are quite big.

To run the project:
- Download the whole folder in order to run the different notebooks on your local machine.

- Additionally, download the two datasets artists.csv and tracks.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks 
in order to join the datasets with the subsequent workflow.

- Make sure to adjust the file paths to the csv files, which could potentially provide issues (pd.read_csv("")).

Happy Coding!
